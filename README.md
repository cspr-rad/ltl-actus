# LTL ACTUS

The [algorithmic contract types unified standard](https://actusfrf.org) executed in [linear temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic)

## Example (WIP): Execution trace of a loan

``` sh
nix develop
$ RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
$ cat actus/execution.log 
```

This is intended to be a **demo** in a **toy version of ACTUS**
