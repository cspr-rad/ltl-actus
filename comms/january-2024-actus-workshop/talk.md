# Logic

- What is logic
- Why it matters in financial software

## What is logic

Study of an argument's _structure_

### Example: modus ponens

If it is raining, then the ground is wet. It is raining. Therefore, the ground is wet.

### Example: modus tollens

If it is snowing, then it is cold outside. It is not cold outside. Therefore, it is not snowing.

## The connectives 

### And 

$P \land Q$ if and only if $P$ is true and $Q$ is true. 

### Or

$P \lor Q$ if and only if at least one of $P$ or $Q$ is true

### Not

$\neg $ if and only if $P$ is not true 

## The quantifiers

### For all / for every

$\forall x, Px$ is true if $P$ is always true regardless of what $x$ is

### There exists / for some

$\exists x, Px$ is true if $P$ is true at least once throughout values of $x$

## Why logic matters in software and finance

### Beyond quality assurance

Testing on steroids: quantified proofs rather than piecemeal instances

### Formal verification

- Quantify ("for all") over a program's inputs, execution traces of nondeterministic programs, or over all programs of a language
- Prove correctness with respect to a specification

# Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)

- Beyond truth to truth _when_
- Logic that's aware of timestep

## The modal operators

### Always

$\Box P$ is true if $P$ is true regardless of timestep

### Eventually

$\Diamond P$ is true if $P$ will come true at some timestep, but possibly not yet

## Verifying a traffic light with LTL

### A traffic light should never be green in all directions 

$\Box \left( \text{(northGreen} \land \text{southGreen)} â†’ \neg (\text{eastGreen} \lor \text{westGreen}) \right)$
  
### A traffic light should eventually turn green in all directions

$\Box \Diamond \text{northGreen} \land \Box \Diamond \text{southGreen} \land \Box \Diamond \text{eastGreen} \land \Box \Diamond \text{westGreen}$

# Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standard (ACTUS)

## PAM

Pay interest periodically, but principal only at end of term

## PAM in LTL

### The terms are static throughout lifetime of contract

$\Box$ Terms(`principal`=1000, `ir`=0.05, `months`=24)

### The eventual total repayment is equal to the principal plus interest

$\Box$ State(`total_repayment`=`principal` * (1 + `ir` / 12) * months) 

### We connect each of these temporal propositions together with "and" ($\land$)

# LTL-ACTUS (demo)

Linear temporal logic as the financial execution environment
