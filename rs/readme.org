#+TITLE: LTL ACTUS

** Example (WIP): Execution trace of a loan

No dependencies between tests, but the log file will be written correctly if the runner is single threaded.

#+BEGIN_SRC
nix develop ./../#rs
$ RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -- --test-threads=1
$ cat execution_trace.log
#+END_SRC

This is a *demo* in a *toy version of ACTUS*
